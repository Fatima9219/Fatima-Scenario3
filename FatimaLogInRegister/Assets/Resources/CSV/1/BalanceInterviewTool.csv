0,1,Four Freedoms,What do you think has been the impact of the EU's policy on freedom of movement in your country?,"Freedom of movement has been a fantastic opportunity for our young people, allowing them to visit and work in lots of different European countries.",Freedom of movement is a disaster for young people. They can't find employment because of all these Europeans coming here and taking up our jobs.
1,2,Social Impact,What do you think the impact of the EU has been on everyday society in your country?,"It has really transformed things for the better. It's much easier to get hold of workmen to do jobs, and there are lots of new European delis opening locally.","It's causing real problems. It's increased the pressure on our doctor's surgery and our local school, with all these families coming here from other countries."
2,3,Security,What impact do you think the EU has had on security in your country?,EU initiatives like the European Arrest Warrant have made law enforcement across the EU much easier.,The influx of migrants from eastern Europe has definitely added to crime levels in our area.
3,4,Feelings,How would you feel if your country voted to leave the EU? OR How do you feel about the UK leaving the EU?,Leaving the EU is a really positive thing. It means we can take back control of our lives without deferring to Brussels all the time.,Leaving the EU is a disaster. It will affect our economy and make it much more difficult to travel to other European countries.
4,5,Jobs/ Economy,What impact do you think the EU has had on the economy of your country?,Our economy has benefited enormously from being part of a single market of 600 million people. The evidence is in our annual growth rates.,Being in the EU has had some benefits but it has prevented us from trading more freely with other countries in the world who would like to buy our goods.
5,6,Sovereignty,Do you think that being in the EU has made any noticeable difference to the way your country is governed?,Being in the EU hasn't stopped us from making our own laws just as we did before. And lots of European regulations are just common sense.,"We seem to spend far too much time having to adhere to European regulations, whether it's straight bananas or whatever."
6,7,Cultrual Closeness,Do you think that membership of the EU has brought its different member countries closer together?,I really think that European countries are more understanding of each other when we're all in the EU. And the EU has helped to build the peace after Second World War.,The EU hasn't really made a difference. We all speak different languages for a start and have our own national cultures and beliefs.
7,8,Environment,What impact do you think the EU has had on environmental issues - in Europe and beyond?,The EU has been really important in leading world opinion on climate change. Look at the way that all the countries came together to sign the Paris Climate Change Accord.,The EU can't really make any different to be honest. Look at the way Donald Trump can just walk away from the Paris Climate Change Accord. We really don't have that much influence.
8,9,Fair Treatment,Do you think the EU manages to treat its citizens fairly?,We all have European citizenship and that gives us certain rights wherever we are in Europe. And human rights have been a major aspect of what the EU does.,Every country makes its own laws really. The EU doesn't really have much influence over the rights of national citizens.
