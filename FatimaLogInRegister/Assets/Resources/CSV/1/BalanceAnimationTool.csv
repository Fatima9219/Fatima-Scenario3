0,1,Politics,Would you not rather have the Brussels elite in charge than UKIP and Nigel Farage?,Brussels is far too remote - we need to be making our own laws back here in the UK.,It doesn't really matter - all the politicians just say the same things and keep making the same points.
1,2,Economy and Job,"After Brexit, the UK economy could be around 6% smaller by 2030 and that would mean a loss of income equivalent to £4,300 a year for every British household.",But once we've left the EU we'll be able to strike deals with the rest of the world so we'll be fine.,I don't really care so long as my kids get jobs when they leave school.
2,3,Feelings/ Emotions,I feel really worried about leaving the EU. It feels like we're turing our backs on the rest of the world.,All the people I know are really pleased about leaving Europe. We're planning a street party for when we go.,I'm worried about how easy it will be to go on holiday.
3,4,History and Culture,Nationalism is on the rise again across Europe and history tells us that that can only be a bad thing.,But everybody feels more attached to their own country than to Europe as a whole.,It depends whether you mean nationalism or patriotism.
4,5,Security,For me one of the main benefits of EU membership has been to prevent war between the nations of Europe.,But there's still lots of tensions between EU countries. It's only a matter of time before there's trouble somewhere.,I don't feel as if I know enough about it. What should we do about Putin and Russia?
